ProgressRingforWindowsPhone
===========================

As you know Windows Phone doesn't have a "ProgressRing" control (Windows 8 has!). So, I provided a sample project to use it your own projects.

If you want to see how can you add that control to your Windows Phone project step-by-step from the beggining of creating a new project, check this: http://www.onurtirpan.com/onur-tirpan/english/windows-phone-english/using-progressring-in-windows-phone/
